# it is a priority queve
# here it consists of min heap where it is a binary with a minimum number is on the top
# if we pop of an element from the tree the tree is seperated and then the tree decides the sucessor of the root node based on the minimum conditions.
# heap push -> pushing new item where it checks the position it should fit in the binary tree, swapping begins with checking if the number added on the end is bigger from it's parent node
